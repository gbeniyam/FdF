get next line? Read in files, get x/y/z coordinates from each point.
	x = nth number in row without spaces.
	y = row/line
	z = value at row,line.

Hold values on heap, allocate memory based on size of text file.
strlen of each line, multiply by amount of lines (get_next_line to count i
lines).

parse paramters, double pointer, fd. main.c opens file, grabs fd and
passes in fd param.
